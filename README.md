# Little Helpers

A collection of small little helper projects and utility scripts for myself

These projects usually solve a small task or issue by providing an automated solution or helper program. However there is no guarantee that these are kept up to date or do work on any other system than my own. There is no consistency in regards to technology, programming language and so on. Every little helper should contain a `README.md` file giving a little more context (but maybe I was too lazy to write one). If not otherwise specified the programs/scripts are only tested on Linux and might have additional runtime dependencies or need a specific "setup"

Use them for your own inspiration, but don't expect anything more :-)
